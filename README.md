# BaseballStatCalculator 

Hello other baseball fans, I'm just a 20 year old college student who enjoys programming and loves/plays baseball!

**Program will output the stats in the IDE console and into a text file incase stats wanted to be shared!**

(If you come across any bugs or possible improvements feel free to contact me and let me know!)
